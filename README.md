# GMT Manager
A plugin for [MusicBee](http://getmusicbee.com) to help manage music Genres, Moods and Themes

### Info

Although there are good tagging tools in MusicBee, non of them let the user easily import and manage multiple values for Genres, Moods and Themes. So this tool was created.

GMT Manager is composed by two main tools:

* A manual importer where the user manually search and select the GMT tags to import
* A bot that automatically looks for and fills the appropriate tags, based on pre selected option by the user

#### Manual Importer

 1. Select the files to import
 2. Right-Click > GTM Manager

#### Bot Importer

 1. Filter the main view with tracks to tag
 2. MainMenu > Tools > Tagging Tools > GMT Bot
 3. Fill the settings (by default the last used is loaded)
 4. Press Start Bot

#### Future Plans

 * Refactor to improved code readability
 * Allow multiple bot instances side by side
 * Write better tests
 * Design a better UI to filter the Bot log
 * Make the UI look closer to the MusicBee one

#### How to report bugs

 * Open a Issue in [Github](https://github.com/Davidblkx/GMT-Manager/issues)
 * Respond to the forum post in [MusicBee Forum](http://getmusicbee.com/forum/index.php?topic=20765.0)
